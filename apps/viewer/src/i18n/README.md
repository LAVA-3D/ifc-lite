# Viewer localization

English is the in-tree fallback. Feature catalogues live in `catalogues/` and
are composed in `en.ts`; keep them bounded to one user-facing feature instead
of growing a single catalogue file.

Translations must preserve every named parameter in their English template.
Callers pass formatted display values, while translators control word order,
punctuation, spacing, and unit placement. Use complete messages for states
rather than assembling translated fragments, lowercasing labels, or appending
suffixes. Missing keys fall back to English; an explicit empty string remains
empty.

The Section-tool catalogue contains 69 strings covering the mounted 3D
Section subtree: plane controls and state messages, cap styling, visualization
badges and the drag-gizmo tooltip, plus the two entry labels that open a 2D
drawing. It deliberately does not cover the drawing panel, toolbar, tours,
number formatting, or locale persistence. Locales registered in tests exercise
fallback and live catalogue replacement; they are not languages shipped by
the viewer.
